How to Play the Game :
The purpose of the game is to move our player through the three-lane road section.
We can control our player with the arrow keys.
On the road section, enemy beetles pass through the road at random speed
from left to right. These must be avoided. If that succeeds, we reach the
waterfront. Then we get a reward point. If we collide with a beetle, we get
a penalty point. The result is displayed at the bottom of the track.
The beetle speed can be adjusted.
